            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How does AfetNet work offline?</h3>
                <p>AfetNet uses Bluetooth mesh networking to communicate with nearby devices when internet is unavailable. All data is stored locally on your device and shared only with nearby users.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is the Early Warning System (EEW) reliable?</h3>
                <p>The EEW system is experimental and should not be your primary source of earthquake warnings. Always follow official sources like AFAD and Kandilli. False alarms and missed warnings are possible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I share logs for debugging?</h3>
                <p>In the app, go to Settings → Support → Share Logs. This will generate a debug report that you can email to our support team.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I delete all my data?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Go to Settings → "Delete All My Data" to completely clear all local data from your device. This action cannot be undone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Does AfetNet collect personal information?</h3>
                <p>AfetNet stores data locally on your device and only shares messages temporarily with nearby devices via P2P. We don't collect personal information for tracking purposes. See our <a href="privacy.en.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why do I need location permission?</h3>
                <p>Location permission is optional but recommended for help requests. It allows you to share your approximate location when requesting help during emergencies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why do I need Bluetooth permission?</h3>
                <p>Bluetooth is essential for P2P mesh networking. It allows AfetNet to communicate with nearby devices and relay emergency information when internet is unavailable.</p>
            </div>
